## üé≠ Summary
-  Before leaving they speak to an old man who never left the tavern, who mentions their dwarf  nan (no relation),  who was supposed to be back from the mountains (This contributes to badgers decisions to go on the quest)
-  We find a Small camp  that has been taken ransacked, and mostly eaten by mimics
-  Darryn finds small mimic, in the form of a mug, that is already fed and purrs at their touch
- Darryn has found plink and will not let them go, no matter how many times ga-al says they're dangerous
- Vidal hunts around, but sees very few things are actually taken. A few valuables, and the wizards spell book, but things like the shield, and armour are left untouched. Perculiar

- It was an ambush.
- A single man, half the size of morte (to say very small and skinny), holds  them at sword point
- Vidal is amused at the person who doesnt look to sure
- Ga-al sees the marking on their arm,  the  same one from the troll
- Decides to play along, and forces the guard to focus on him

- The guard takes him a hostage, with ga-al sending "message"  to vidal to wait  then track them back to the hideout
- Darryn is used as scout
- Vidal is annoyed at being sober, and talks with badger along the way
- Morte is  nervous to be back in the forest
- They see the guard take ga-al into this crack in the  mountain wall
- Two guards are placed out front in chainmail armour
