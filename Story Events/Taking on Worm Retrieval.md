## ðŸ“† Event Details
- **Related Characters:** [[Bartholomu Melru The 4th]]  
- **Factions Involved:** [[The Three Eyed Gang]]  

## ðŸŽ­ Summary
- The group are approached by Bartholomu Melru the 4th, Raven on Shoulder
- Morte is particularly interesting in Raven (Start of pet Obsession)
- He says that the bandits, locally known as the Three Eyed Gang took his stuff.
- Get specifically the Work with a jar in it. And maybe a specific book he wrote
- Reward, anything else we can find plus a property worth 1.2k in gold to be deeded to the group
- Darryn Negotiates travel to Windmere

Reasons members want to go:
- Morte: Hiding from Hunters, and thinks Vidal could take on Ukhoda if needed, and he needs to start getting to grip with "Civilisation" and thinks this group look pretty civilised too him (They're not)
- Darryn: Loot, and Money. Plus mention of travel to windemere keeps them moving around
- Badger: Simple Devotion to faith. He saw the mark on the troll, and connected with the description provided, he thinks that they caused the attack on this village. "If it be wrong to avenge, the let savras stop him"
- Vidal: He wouldve done it anyway, money for booze sweetens the deal
- Ga-al: Bartholomu described the property, and Ex-inn. He could easily spread the message of his book.
