## üé≠ Summary
> Upon returning to the Atlas Inn, Crimson would begin to prepare himself to move his tower. Once he had finished explaining to the tower as to why it needed to move to the Nine Hells, Crimson would finally have some time to sit and think about what had transpired within the past week.

This thinking would become a rabbit hole that consumed his attention for the rest of the day. The result of this thought process would be tough to accept, it would require Crimson to fully embrace the power given to him by Sutekh. To do this, Crimson would have to return to his tower, a journey that would need a couple days of preparation to complete. Despite the pain he would suffer, Crimson knew that he had to do this, it was either embrace the power of Sutekh or be forever shadowed by etroM.

The next 2 days would see Crimson almost completely isolate himself in the basement. He would need to focus completely on the spell gifted to him by his tower. He would use this spell to request and retrieve the dimension door orb that he had kept on the 173rd floor of the tower.

Once these 2 days had passed, Crimson would approach the group and explain his plan to return to his tower and seek as much power from Sutekh as possible. Something about this explanation would confuse Crimson. Why did he feel compelled to let the others know? This confusion would become minute, as Crimson would proceed to extend an invitation to the group, one that would let them visit his tower and move around nearly completely uninhibited. This was most confusing. Despite his urgency, Crimson would choose to wait until the following day to depart, in order to give the group time to think about his offer.

As the day began, Crimson would head back into the basement and begin to draw his dimension door (one that he knew would be linked to his tower once the orb was added). The door would shimmer into life, Abyssal and Hellish magic seeping from it. Crimson would step through, and in doing so forsake his connection to the Abyss.
