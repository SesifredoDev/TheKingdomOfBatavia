## 📖 What Happened?
 ⦁ The story pertains to the about the ‘All Trinity’ Gods. The most powerful Grand gods of the realm who supposedly made the other gods. This consisted of Mordin, the lawful good dwarven God of creation and the all father, Bane the evil god tyranny and war viewed as Mordins opposite, and Helm the god of protection representing neutrality and balance in the world. Together they balance the world and rule over all other gods, planes of existence and afterlives.

⦁ Millions of years ago they created the other thousands of lesser gods and all the worlds and countries in the universe.

⦁ While many stories exist in the mythology the main tale supposedly happened 4049 years ago at year 0, the end of [The Fall](https://www.notion.so/The-Fall-9ad396df22c04497bafe517bd30614cf?pvs=21).

⦁ A 10000-year battle where a great evil took place, destroying the world and shaking the landscape giving the globe mountains, volcanos and earthquakes. The war killed the worlds inhabitants, gods and demigods that looked over its people. Only by the might of the all-trinity gods chosen gladiators, a small group of heroes consisting of mere mortals was this great evil driven out and locked away. This final battle marked the beginning of a new age and every year since has been referred to as Post fall. This is to reference the fall of the great evil and the gods. No one has heard from the ‘all trinity’ since.

⦁ Weather this really happened or is a tale of time is debated by academics and religious figures alike for as long as they’ve been around to do so.

⦁ Either way the Post fall calendar is used for simplifications around the Batavia region and due to the power, the trinity church has over rules of law in Batavia.
