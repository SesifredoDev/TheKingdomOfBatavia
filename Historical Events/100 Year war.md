## üìñ What Happened?
 ‚¶Å One large event was the 100-year war where the elven houses fought the rest of the Batavia region under the command of the conquer Mindartis Yaeldrin Great Grandfather to the current young elven king Ivellios. A cruel dictator of his time able to rally hate and fear against the other factions in Batavia unifying the elven houses at the time against one common cause.

‚¶Å Mindartis felt elves where second to non and even the gods themselves are unable to rival the true ‚Äòuntapped‚Äô potential from the 12 unified elven houses.

‚¶Å The conquer was obsessed with collecting more power from an early age learning skills in weaponry and general tactics while his peer‚Äôs learnt art, language, and medicine. When it came to magic, Mindartis was never proficient in the matter despite his elven background.

‚¶Å As a boy Mindartis was sent to a school in Elendire to study under the human master Xandri. Xandri taught the ruler to be the ways of magic from all walks of life not just the elven book magic. He learnt about history and art; he studied the ways of all the great and lesser houses even taking field trips to view the culture. Xandri showed Mindartis why the borders exist and the history of how the Batavia region came to be.

‚¶Å This personal tutoring style under one of the great academics of the time made the elven boy a prodigy of most areas.

‚¶Å While Xandri was tasked to slow the Childs obsession with war down by the parents, he inadvertently fuelled it more. Xandri talked about creating a better world and told Mindartis was the solution, a statement innocent in nature twisted into a war cry.

‚¶Å Mindartis Killed his master and fled the capital and was chased by guards for 7 nights before reporting him missing.

‚¶Å The official report was Mindartis escaped into a cave that had flooded by the time the guards had caught up killing the boy.

‚¶Å It is unknown what became of the elven master in the next 400 years with no reports of accounts of where he went but when he returned to the elven capital of yllimel the elders are quoted saying ‚Äúthe prince who left was merely a spark to the kings flame that returned‚Äù, noting if it was note for his royal genetic traits he would not have been recognised.

‚¶Å The Yaeldrin rulers had died while Mindartis was away and so a council of elders had stepped in the keep the peace until a new royal line was created or Mindartis returned.

‚¶Å Once instated as king he set out to unify the 12 elven houses leveraging his position of power to aggravate the other great house‚Äôs people into aggressive actions against the elven people in non-elven cities, this sparked a revolution against the other houses and the 4th kingdom of Batavia.

‚¶Å This broke the union and with the terror and hate in society it was easy for Mindartis to unite the elven houses.

‚¶Å From there Mindartis used his new dark magic to poison the son of the orc lord glor Angalor. The blame was placed upon the dwarven houses started a small civil war in the village of itrumill between the dwarven house of poil and the orc house of winstl.

‚¶Å With the nation divided the Elven army marched on the north island taking the area in a matter of months.

‚¶Å Mindartis was known for his aggressive tactics based on speed. He used and taught dark brutal magic to the elven houses leaving any of those caught by his magic and survived was left mentally scarred to the point of immobility for the rest of their days.

‚¶Å This war lasted 100 years and was ended by the Nobel actions of a group of heroes to the realm.

‚¶Å While the war had ended the elves where subject to a segregated and solitary life away from the rest of the nation, only in the last 300 years have they began to renter bloodlines such as half elves and communities.

‚¶Å Mindartis had 2 children, 1 carried on the Yaeldrin rule after the war and the other disappeared during the war, presumed dead although body was never found.

‚¶Å Minidarties was obsessed with finding more power during the war and claimed to be on pursuit of God like power.

‚¶Å The heros mentioned ‚Äòstopped‚Äô Mindarties in a battle lasting 60 minutes in a cave not far from hemdell. Mindarties was attempting a ritual to ‚Äòend not just this war but all wars‚Äô, this was clearly the dark lord failed to understand as a portal opened only for him to be shot and fall into. A large explosion followed and once the ruins where examined his teeth and armour where left indicating his fiery demise and the end of the war.

‚¶Å This cave can still be visited as a tourist sight with Mindarties armour put up and has historians leading guided tours around the battle sight.

‚¶Å In modern time we are in the 52nd year of the 5th reunification of the kingdom of Batavia unifying the 4 great houses.
