## 🏛️ Basic Info

- **Role:** BBEG
- **Race:** High Elf, Turned Abyssal Entity
- **Age:** Ludicrously Old (Likely over 900 years, considering his lifespan and time in the Abyss)
- **Affiliation:** The Abyss, potentially commands abyssal entities or a cult following.
- **Location:** [[Abyss]]

## 🎭 Personality & Motivations

- **Core Traits:** Cruel, power-hungry, manipulative, megalomaniacal, believes in his own superiority (now twisted into abyssal dominance), potentially nihilistic or driven by a warped sense of order through absolute power. The pursuit of "god-like power" has likely been corrupted into a desire to become an abyssal god or ruler.
- **Flaws & Secrets:** His past as Mindartis and the events of the 100-year war could be a vulnerability if revealed. His inability to master traditional elven magic might still be a point of insecurity. The true nature of his transformation in the Abyss and the extent of his current power are secrets. He might underestimate those he once considered beneath him.
- **What Do They Want?** To achieve ultimate power, likely through domination of the mortal realm by the Abyss or by bringing about a cataclysmic event that aligns with abyssal principles. He might seek to "end all wars" in a twisted, destructive way by consuming all existence within the Abyss. He could also seek revenge on the descendants of those who stopped him or view the current reunification of Batavia as an obstacle to his grander plans.

## 📖 Backstory & Role in the Story

> Mindartis Yaeldrin, the once ambitious and cruel elven king, was seemingly destroyed when he fell into a mysterious portal during a failed ritual. However, instead of oblivion, he was drawn into the [[Abyss]]. Over the centuries spent in this chaotic realm, the potent and corrupting energies of the Abyss twisted his elven essence, amplifying his desire for power and transforming him into an abyssal entity. His memories of his mortal life, his obsession with power, and his belief in his own potential have been warped by the Abyss, fueling a desire for dominion that now extends beyond Batavia to encompass the mortal realm. He may be orchestrating events from the Abyss, manipulating cults, or planning a direct invasion. The current reunification of Batavia could be a catalyst for his return, either as a target to be shattered or as a potential tool to be corrupted for his own ends. His knowledge of Batavia's history, its factions, and the Yaeldrin bloodline gives him a unique advantage. The heroes of the present may uncover his survival and transformation as they investigate current threats, realizing the true scope of the ancient evil they face.

## 🔗 Relationships

- **Connected Characters:** 
	- [[Ivellios Yaeldrin]] (distant descendant)
	- potentially spirits or echoes of [[Xandri]] within the Abyss, descendants of the heroes who stopped him.
	- [[Duende]]
- **Enemies/Rivals:** The current rulers and influential figures of the unified Batavia, particularly those who champion peace and unity. Potentially powerful entities within the Abyss itself if he seeks to usurp their power.
- **Factions:** Commands abyssal entities, might have a cult of worshippers in the mortal realm who unknowingly (or knowingly) serve his abyssal agenda known as J.R&Co.

## 📝 Notes

> The ritual Mindartis was performing might have been intended to tap into abyssal energies, inadvertently leading to his transformation. His knowledge of ancient Batavia and its magic could give him access to forgotten powers within the Abyss. The nature of his "dark magic" from his mortal life might have been a precursor to his abyssal transformation. The missing child of Mindartis could potentially be a pawn or a key figure in his plans, either corrupted by the Abyss or a potential source of conflict. The tourist attraction of his demise might hold clues or be a point of interest for his followers.
