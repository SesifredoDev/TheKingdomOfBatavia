## 📖 Backstory & Role in the Story
> *"
> For the ensuing three years, Badger was embroiled in their lawless exploits, raiding across the Summer Bay and the Altina Sea. Among these escapades, the raid on Twil stood out, a mission that unwittingly led to a liaison with an engaged human aristocrat named Ariana Eastguard. Twil became the stage for the Phantom Raiders' elegant operation, an opportunity for reconnaissance.

Badger, seizing a chance to infiltrate the Eastguard Villa, accepted a job as a cleaner, ostensibly to survey the most valuable items. But an unexpected connection developed between Badger and Ariana, the Eastguards' daughter. They found common ground, and Badger, longing for someone to confide in, disclosed his true identity.

As the crew prepared for their raid during the night, Badger, ensconced within the villa, remained with Ariana. But when the cannons roared, signaling the commencement of chaos in Twil, Badger knew his time was running out. With the cannons' thunder echoing in the background, he attempted to slip away, intending to reunite with the Phantom Raiders. Ariana, waking up just in time, discovered Badger on the brink of departure.

Ariana, desperately pleading for Badger to stay, recited the intimate moments they had shared, her voice cracking under the weight of emotions. She reminded him of his confessions and the genuine connection they had forged. Badger stood on the precipice of a momentous decision when cannonballs suddenly rained down upon the Eastguard Villa. In a panic, he bolted, believing that if he returned to the ship the Phantom Raiders would end their siege.
