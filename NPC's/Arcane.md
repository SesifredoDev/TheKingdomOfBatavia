## 📖 Backstory & Role in the Story

Arcane was once a promising scholar of the arcane arts, fascinated by the lost magics of an ancient civilization. Their research led them to the Atlas Anderi, where they worked within its ranks for years, searching for an artifact of immense power. However, something went wrong—either they were betrayed, or their own ambitions led to a catastrophic failure.

It’s believed that Darryn’s family was involved in the event that ruined Arcane’s plans, possibly hiding or destroying what they sought. Arcane has spent years unraveling the threads of that past, and their interest in Darryn is no coincidence. They don’t just see the rogue as a nuisance—they see them as a key.

Now, Arcane’s influence is growing again, and their pursuit of the artifact is nearing its final stages. Whether Darryn can stop them—or if they might be tempted to join them—is yet to be decided.
