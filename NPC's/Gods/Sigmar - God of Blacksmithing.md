## 📖 Backstory & Role in the Story
> Sigmar Heldenhammer is the lord of the tempest, protector of humanity, keeper of Order and scourge of Chaos. He spends most of time in the heavenly realm of Azyr on his golden throne, where he is ever vigilant of signs of chaos and corruption.However, this is not the current state of the God-King. Sigmar was watching from his temple on the World-that-Was, when it was destroyed in a mystical explosion, leaving the God-King clinging to the cooling husk of the core of Mallus (the World-that-Was), the only remaining part of the world. The magical power used in the attack did not come from an individual creature but instead a whole host of them. This power was so great that it left Sigmar in a state of near-death.
