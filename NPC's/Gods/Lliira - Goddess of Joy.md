## 📖 Backstory & Role in the Story
Lliira initially manifested as brightly whirling lights and smoke in the middle of the air before a young woman danced out from the cloud. This 9 feet (2.7 meters) lady was sensuous and shapely, laughing and dancing through the air without concern for dignity or pride. She had eyes of pure blue, long, golden hair (sometimes streaked with silver or odd pastels of blue, pink, green, or lilac), and wore a tight-fitting body suit under a series of thin, translucent robes which artfully twirled and draped as she moved. A sparkling wake of winking lights trailed behind her as she danced, flashing at least 60 feet (18 meters) behind her and longer if she so desired.
