## 📖 Backstory & Role in the Story
> As Crimson began to settle down for the night, he would hear a faint whisper instructing him to begin the blood rite. Seemingly, without any concern, Crimson would take the many bottles of blood he collected and pour them out into the hellish symbol of Sutekh, Lord of Blood. As he poured, he would recall the information he had pried out of the previous champions of the Lord, ones that he had dispatched with surprising ease. This information would give him power of the Lord of Blood, power that Crimson could use to strike up a mutually beneficial deal with Sutekh.

Once the symbol was complete a rite would be uttered. This rite, a single phrase that would activate the power of blood and summon Sutekh to this very plane (though only temporarily).

Without hesitation Crimson spoke the one sentence that would provide Sutekh a path into the material realm:

“Let Chaos take the World.”

With this single phase being spoken, Sutekh, Lord of Blood made an appearance, visibly intrigued by being summoned by the tiefling known to him only as Crimson, the Abyss’s Chosen.

“Why do you summon me?” boomed Sutekh, “Especially after killing many of my Champions”

“To simply strike a deal” responded Crimson, not even remotely fazed by being in the presence of such a powerful being, “I know that you are looking for a new Champion and I know that you need this Champion to be powerful”

“You suggest that I make YOU my Champion, after everything you’ve done!” exclaimed Sutekh, clearly surprised that Crimson would even imply such a thing, especially since he could instead become the champion of one of the Greater Demons of the Abyss.

“Think of it as more of a partnership. Do not think for one second that I am willing to do anything you say” replied Crimson, still as calm as ever.

“And why would I agree to something like that? A champion that would do anything I wish would be far more important for me” said Sutekh, clearly struck with confusion.

“Well, those loyal enough for that are always too weak, a partnership would give you a powerful ally that can make it easier for you to gain power, whilst simultaneously looking for a loyal servant” replied Crimson, a smile spreading across his face as he savoured the Lord of Blood’s confusion.

“You make a good point, however I must know what you stand to gain from this partnership” demanded Sutekh, his confusion growing more by the second, though he was frustrated that a mortal being was capable of outsmarting him. *I must have this mortal as my partner if not champion* he thought, *the other Lords of Hell must not discover him until I secure a deal with him*.

“I stand to gain a fraction of your power, just enough to further my research but not enough to leave me weak if I were to lose it” stated Crimson, “oh and it will give me some distance from the state of affairs in the upper levels of the Abyss, thus protecting my from Mendartis and his lackeys”

“Ah so you wish to be able to forsake the Abyss one day” concluded Sutekh, thinking he had finally figured out Crimson’s thought process, “I did not realise you were _afraid_ of the powers of the Abyss”. With this single accusation, Crimson’s mode instantly turned sour, bloodlust stained his presence with such potency that even Sutekh himself took a step back in fear.

“I do not fear the Abyss” exclaimed Crimson, now seething with rage “I use it’s special features to further my research, just as I shall use you and your power”

“Now either we have a deal, or I shall banish you back to the Nine Hell’s empty handed, and ensure that the other Lords of Hell know that I seek the power of Hell”

“Further details will be sorted out once you agree to making the deal” finished Crimson

“If that is how it shall be then I will agree to this deal with hopes that this partnership will last for many centuries” responded Sutekh, clearly proud of being able to break Crimson’s calm demeanour.

Following the agreement the following terms were agreed upon as benefits for Crimson:

-          Gains a mask to better hide his identity

-          Gains claws to better harvest the blood of his victims

-          Gains the powers that Sutekh would bestow upon his Champion

-          He can contact Sutekh when needed

-          He gets a tower in the Nine Hells to support his research

The following terms are the benefits for Sutekh:

-          Gains regular blood sacrifices to boost his power

-          Can request Crimson to do specific tasks (though if they go against Crimson’s interests then he shall refuse)

-          Will work to increase Sutekh’s influence on Batavia (unless it would go against Crimson’s interests)

Despite Crimson seemingly getting more out of this deal than Sutekh, Sutekh just became a potential threat to Batavia by having a strong partner. Furthermore, Sutekh is waiting for a scenario that he can use to take full control of Crimson and mould him into the perfect Champion, one that will work to break the chains keeping Sutekh from maintaining a physical form in Batavia.
