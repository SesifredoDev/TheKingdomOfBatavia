## üèôÔ∏è Description



Moving of The Living Tower:
> *The Living Tower, known to be home to Crimson, Betrayer of the Abyss, none know how it works exactly, all that is known is that the inside is much larger than the outside. None have managed to reach the top floor of this tower, with some speculating that it has as many floors as the Abyss has layers (infinite). Only 238 floors have been explored so far (a number set by Crimson himself), other demons and creatures haven‚Äôt explored even half as many as Crimson. Instead, the tower sends them to sections that Crimson decides.

Many have wondered as to how Crimson came to be the Keeper of this tower. Crimson is the only one who knows this story in its entirety.

It began back when Crimson was 7, the tower appeared before him, reeking of a magic that Crimson could not identify at that point (however, he has since come to the assumption that it was magic from the Astral plane). Crimson would enter the tower, filled with curiosity. The tower (as it would always) tried to break Crimson and his curiosity, hoping to force him into wanting to leave. However, Crimson‚Äôs curiosity would break just as he entered the 136th floor. This floor would have only one room (all the previous ones had 3 rooms), the room filled with magic books and chemistry apparatus. Crimson‚Äôs curiosity, whilst broken would be renewed as interest (and to such an extent that it would take 729 years for him to feel this interested in something). Before long, Crimson had started living in the tower, which was only possible due to the tower deciding that this child would be the only creature that could truly appreciate it and all its contents. With this change, the tower would shift and change, suddenly the 136th floor would become the 1st floor to make it easier for Crimson to collect samples to further his studies. The rest of the floors would be shuffled, and upon this discovery, Crimson would become fully aware of the living nature of the tower he called home.

Over the next 729 years, Crimson would slowly explore up to floor 238, however only a handle of floors would be committed to his memory as the tower would always take him to the floor that he needed. This was not the only feature that the tower created specifically for Crimson, it would also create a humanoid extension of itself (in addition to the tower), that could be summoned in a unique way that only Crimson would be capable of. Furthermore, the tower had made 1 promise to Crimson (something it would never break), it would move to another plane if needed, but Crimson would have to be the one to issue this request and specify where the tower would go. This promise was made so that the tower would always be there to support Crimson and his goals for as long as he lived.

It would be around this point (when Crimson was aged 736), that he would leave the Abyss for the first time. This would become a majorly pivotal moment for Crimson as if he were to be found by the Abyss it would mean that returning to his tower would suddenly become impossible (in person at least). Almost as if it preordained, the Abyss (using the soul of Morte to maintain a physical form) would encounter Crimson. These initial encounters would be in the swamp around a town called Omiliri, not that Crimson would realise as the Abyss would stick to watching until the convergence of the Fae Wild. It would be towards the end of the convergence that the Abyss would make itself known to Crimson and the group he was travelling with, by this point Crimson had assumed the identity of a dark elf (a servant of the Demon of Blades). However, this disguise would not be capable of fooling the Abyss as it had watched from the shadows as Crimson assumed this appearance.

Upon the return of Crimson and the group to the Atlas Inn, Crimson would begin formulating a plan to move his tower to the Nine Hells, with the hope that it would listen to him. It was at this point that he would remember the summoning spell that the tower had created for him, _Summoning of the Living Tower._

_Summoning of the Living Tower_

_Casting Time: 10 Minutes_

_Range/Area: 30 ft_

_Components: V, S, M (a vial of Crimson‚Äôs blood, given willingly)_

_Duration: As long as Crimson decides (part of the Verbal component)_

_Effect: Summons the humanoid extension of the tower. The humanoid will only accept orders given by Crimson. Can retrieve an item from the tower (Crimson must know the location of the item beforehand) but will require the humanoid to be summoned a second time._

_Restriction: Can only be cast once per long rest. Crimson takes 4d6 bleeding damage. This damage cannot be reduced by any means and can only be healed by a long or short rest._

It would be through this spell that Crimson would first retrieve a magical orb, one similar to that that his companion Ga‚Äôal had before his passing. This orb would be crucial for Crimson to move to and from certain places, however it had the condition that when casting _Dimension Door_, Crimson would have to inscribe a specific symbol into the spell in order to make it possible to link to the one that had been cast in his tower.
