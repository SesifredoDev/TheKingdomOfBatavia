## üìñ Backstory
>Unlike most people Ymetra can remember everything she experienced from when she first opened her eyes, however despite this she does not know her parents (she doesn‚Äôt let this affect her). What she does remember is opening her eyes and seeing a large imposing door open and a nun step through it and pick her up. This was the start of her life at the Trinity Church and her worship of Helm. It was through the Church that she would discover an innate connection to the radiant magic of the gods.

Ymetra would spend the first 25 years of her life studying under the guide of the Trinity Church, after which she would begin a spiritual journey around Batavia to help the less fortunate discover a life of service to the Church.

Whilst on this journey, Ymetra would end up travelling through the Nestlbrook Forest where she would be forced off the dirt path by a group of bandits. After walking for 3 hours through the forest, she would be ambushed by the bandits. The stress of the ambush would result in Ymetra awakening her true radiant powers in a powerful eruption of radiant energy. The radiant energy that had just exploded out of her body would be drawn back towards her and form wings of pure light on her back.

Just as the bandits were reeling from the brightness of the light, they would open their eyes to discover that their leader was lying on the ground with his skull clearly broken open like an egg and a man in chain mail carrying a shield of the Batavian Army standing over the dead man‚Äôs body.

Once Ymetra had gained control of her power once more she would look up to see this mysterious man kill the last of the bandits.

‚ÄúWho are you?‚Äù she questioned unsure as to whether or not he would kill her as well.

‚ÄúI am a man who seeks his God‚Äôs praise. I am Vidal Sunshield, Paladin of Sigmar‚Äù declared the man.

‚ÄúAre you going to kill me as well?‚Äù whispered Ymetra, still visibly shaken by what she had just witnessed.

‚ÄúNo, for you wield a power similar to that which I seek.‚Äù

‚ÄúTell me which God do you draw your power from and how it is that you can draw upon it‚Äù demanded Vidal, his face depicting a desire for power with a sliver of bloodlust.

Despite his intimidating appearance, Ymetra did not fear him, instead she feared the his greed and the future that would unfold if he were to acquire such power. Furthermore, she did not know where her power came from, for she had never received any divine blessing like the other clerics that she had known.

‚ÄúI cannot tell, for I have not earnt the blessing of a God yet, and so I do not know where my power comes from‚Äù muttering the last part trying to hide it from Vidal.

‚ÄúSo what I need is a blessing from Sigmar and then I should be granted a power even greater than yours‚Äù mumbled Vidal, ‚Äúthen I shall follow the sacred texts I found until I receive a blessing‚Äù he announced.

Despite the fear she felt, Ymetra followed, as Vidal led her to Nestlbrook.

Due to her magical prowess, Ymetra was able to master this newfound power within a couple of months, giving her many abilities (though the most notable was the ability to manifest radiant wings). The manifestation of these abilities, led Ymetra to believe that she had finally received a blessing from Helm, furthering her belief and dedication to the Trinity Church.

Having the ability to fly on wings of pure, radiant light led to some people (especially the less fortunate) seeing her as a goddess, which led to a small religion (Church of the Light of Ymetra) being formed with Ymetra at the center of it. As the religion grew, so too did Ymetra‚Äôs power, however she did not know about this church and the power it was giving her.

After 6 years of travelling and help others, Ymetra concluded that she would be able to better help others if she travelled with a group of adventurers so that they could hopefully prevent more people from suffering. Due to this she decided that she should meet and talk to Vidal to at least get some advice about how to go about joining an adventurer party, and so she began to search for him.

Ymetra‚Äôs search for Vidal led her to _Windmere_, specifically a run-down building called the _Atlas Inn_. However, when she was about to knock the door, a gnome would inform her that Vidal and his companions had left a few nights ago on a quest. Sadly, the gnome was unable to inform Ymetra of where this quest had taken them, and instead directed her towards the _Adventurer‚Äôs Guild_.

It was once Ymetra had spoken to the guild master that she learnt of Vidal‚Äôs part in the adventuring party the _Atlas Anderi_ and that they had taken a quest that took them to _Bayside Harbour_ to find a missing boy that appeared in a series of mysterious sightings after vanishing. Flying into a panic after hearing about the missing child, Ymetra ran outside and flew off after the _Atlas Anderi_, hoping to help save the child and assist the group.

Despite her speed and urgency, Ymetra knew that it would take her close to 15 days of travel to catch up with Vidal and his companions. As she travelled, Ymetra couldn‚Äôt help but fear for the safety of the party as she could tell something dreadful was about to unfold, yet she could not understand where this feeling of dread was coming from.

Something was wrong. Something didn‚Äôt sit right with Ymetra.

On the 5th day of travel, the sun was suddenly eclipsed.

Suddenly it hit her, Ymetra‚Äôs power had started to grow, she didn‚Äôt know why as the scriptures that she had read during her studies, told her that her godly magic wouldn‚Äôt work in this place.

Before Ymetra could piece together what was happening she was approached by a small group of people. They claimed to be a group of adventurers. After being asked about where they were and if they knew of a group called the Atlas Anderi, these adventurers claimed the title for themselves in order to manipulate Ymetra into joining their hunt.All they told Ymetra was that she had been dragged into a realm called the Abyss, and that Vidal had been abducted by their quarry. Ymetra quickly requested to join this group without realising that they were lying to her.

Ymetra would not find Vidal.

Ymetra would not leave the Abyss.

Ymetra would fall.

The Abyss is home to a great Demon of Shifting and Changing. This Demon is the father of a blue Tiefling named Crimson. This tiefling has spent his entire life in the Abyss, all 736 years (though that is by his personal Abyssal time, in Batavian time he is only 117 years old).

Despite being a Demon, Crimson‚Äôs father has been surprisingly caring towards his son (though this is likely due to Crimson being his only offspring to be chosen by the Abyss and inherit his power). As a result of his father‚Äôs kindness, Crimson has learnt to use his Shifting and Changing abilities, this is done by extracting the memories and personality from a corpse‚Äôs spine and brain. Through this ability, Crimson is able to become someone with such intricate detail that even the corpse‚Äôs closest friends are unable to tell that it is an illusion. Most would expect that this ability would not do much when attempting to mimic magic powers (especially those gifted by the Gods), however, due to Crimson‚Äôs affinity to magic he is able to cast the exact same spells (though these spells have subtle appearances that give away that the magic is Abyssal in nature).

In regard to his Shifting and Changing abilities, once he assumes the persona of a corpse, the corpse begins to decompose and nothing can slow down the process (once the brain and spine have decomposed he assumes his original form). On top of this, if Crimson sustains damage whilst assuming the form of someone else, the corpse will suffer the same damage (thus speeding up the decomposing process). In addition, as a master of these abilities, Crimson can cancel the transformation (which results in the corpse instantly decomposing).

During his time in the Abyss, Crimson has been the target of many adventuring groups hired to eliminate him and his father (due to the potential of his power). One of these groups seemed incredibly unprepared (apart from an Aasimar cleric).

This group have since been forgotten by Crimson (due to their lack of impact), however, their cleric (called Ymetra) left such a lasting impression (as she was the sole reason the group didn‚Äôt die within the first moments of the encounter) that Crimson decided to put her body into his tower in the Abyss in order to call upon her identity when it became necessary.

A week after this encounter, Crimson heard of a group of adventurers that were trying to escape the Abyss and set out on a journey to see if they would actually get past Mendartis and escape the realm he called home. Or this is what he told everyone, in reality he had heard whispers and rumours that the group had a member that could transform into a dragon. This simple rumour that many dismissed as a blatant lie intrigued Crimson greatly, and as such his reason for infiltrating the group blossomed.

Crimson was lucky enough to catch the final moments of the group‚Äôs attempt at gaining freedom from the Abyss and witnessed the death of a member he would later learn to be the Paladin, Vimhal (or whatever his name was, Crimson honestly doesn‚Äôt care about weak humans). It was also here that Crimson discovered the group had entered the Abyss from a well in some pathetic human town (why learn the name of a place so insignificant).

Due to an unknown breach between the Abyss and Batavia, Crimson was able to leave (due to either luck or the Abyss understanding his plan), Crimson found himself outside a small town that had been overran by pirates.

Just as he was about to leave this unknown town behind, he felt a small almost negligible surge of Abyssal energy as something broke into this mortal realm. Crimson simply assumed that it was this group, though he still didn‚Äôt know their name and could only hope that they would reveal a hint towards having escaped from the Abyss. It was at this point that Crimson would adopt the identity of the Ymetra.

Crimson would meet this group in something called the ‚ÄúMystery Inn‚Äù (which he assumes is somewhere lesser beings go to try and forget the hardships of life). It is in this building that he would encounter Morte (a member of the group Crimson is seeking to infiltrate), it would be Morte who informed Crimson of the group‚Äôs name, the _Atlas Anderi_, its members and Morte‚Äôs connection to the Abyss. Surprisingly enough, the rest of the group would accept Crimson into their ranks (not that they realised what they had done).

To understand Crimson‚Äôs motives for certain decisions (especially with this group) is to understand his obsession with satisfying the itch of intrigue. This itch can be caused by only a handful of things; however, the main triggers are:

-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Rumours of something rather uncommon (such as a person being able to transform into a dragon)

-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† People that are connected to the Abyss through deals with its inhabitants (especially those who willingly agree to the offers of demons and other creatures of the Abyss).

-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Those that manage to escape the Abyss (this is not a common occurrence and as such those that manage it are strong enough to garner some respect).

Despite this motivation, there are things that Crimson will never forsake in order to satisfy the itch, these things are few in number but can be the difference between him fully committing to decisions and abandoning the intrigue all together. These few specifics are:

-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Himself. Any major threat to his life must be dealt with or avoided (often the difference between dealing with and avoiding a threat comes down to how intriguing something is)

-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Nothing can threaten his freedom

-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Nothing can have negative impact on his overarching desire

Similarly, there are things that will make Crimson forsake his intrigue, this is primarily caused by intriguing individuals being unable to live up to what he considers to be _basic standards_. These standards are things that Crimson expects (especially from this group), and that is that creatures Crimson deems to be weaker than most cannot deal meaningful damage. If any pathetically weak creature manages to inflict too much damage to a member of the group (or any damage to Crimson), he will become both enraged and disappointed, disappointed in the group for being unable to deal with such an inconsequential threat and enraged that such a lesser being would even think of attacking him. This rage should be avoided, for it causes Crimson to overwhelm his opponent with magic that others would deem as far to excessive.

Secrets are power.
