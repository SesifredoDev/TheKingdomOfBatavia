## üìñ Backstory
> The Fiddlefens, a name well-respected in Waterhaven, were known for their unwavering commitment to honest toil. The Patriarch, Snaanbag, established the shipyard almost two centuries ago, laying the foundation for the family's maritime legacy. Matriarch Odahani, on the other hand, was a brilliant inventor, deeply immersed in the world of naval technology. It was their common pursuits that led to their union 150 years ago, coinciding with the birth of their eldest, Helsin.

Helsin, bearing the weight of familial expectations, readily embraced the family tradition, walking in Snaanbag's footsteps. He was the heir apparent to the shipyard, a fact as evident as the tides. His birth was a precursor to continued prosperity and perpetuity of the family's seafaring endeavours.

Thirty-six years after Helsin's birth, Wilser, the middle sibling, entered the world. However, he chose a different path, opting to embrace the bustling life of the city over the confined world of the shipyard. His wits and charm made him a successful alchemist, a master of connections, and a shrewd entrepreneur.

Then, 85 years later, Badger, the youngest and most recent addition to the Fiddlefen clan arrived, carrying with him a cargo of great expectations. His brothers, already established in their own right, were constant reminders of what Badger was yet to achieve. They regaled him with tales of their exploits, inadvertently stoking his inner fires of envy. They poked and prodded, well aware of the powder keg of jealousy within him, and often succeeded in triggering an eruption.

The burden of familial comparisons, however, was not confined to his brothers alone. His parents consistently measured him against his siblings, a relentless yardstick. Badger struggled to match Helsin's studiousness or Wilser's charisma, and the constant comparison left him yearning for an escape from the constraints of his heritage. Daydreams filled his mind, painting vibrant images of a carefree life unburdened by expectations.

Gazing through his window, Badger saw the magnificent vessels taking shape in the shipyard, watched the diligent dockworkers laboring, and his imagination began to weave a narrative where life on the open sea was untroubled and unhurried.

But on his 38th birthday, a heated family dispute ensued, a conflict that would shatter the fragile equilibrium. His parents, weary of his perceived idleness, delivered an ultimatum, a bitter pill to swallow. They decreed that if, by the time he reached 40 - an age marking Gnomes' transition to adulthood - he failed to establish a business of his own, he would be disowned, exiled from the harbour of his lineage.

Words were exchanged in the heat of the moment, words that could never be taken back. Badger, overwhelmed by emotions, fled into the night's embrace, searching for sanctuary. In the obscure harbour, he stumbled upon a ship about to embark on an unknown voyage. Without forethought, he clandestinely stowed away in the ship's dark belly. The damp cracks in the wood of the hull served as tiny homes to spiders, mildly disturbing Badger. His resolve being stronger in his conscious mind, forcing him to remain quiet in his placement.

Time passed, and Badger remained hidden, his future decided by the vessel's course. He eventually emerged from his concealment, realizing too late that the ship he had chosen was not what it seemed. The sailors were not sailors at all; they were covert pirates, a band known as the "Phantom Raiders" in disguise, a ruse to procure a newly minted Brigantine from the Waterhaven shipyard.

The captain of this motley crew, a disreputable Dwarf, bearing the moniker Bromadin "Pigeon Eater" Tonguck, revelled in the prospect of an extra deckhand. Badger was conscripted into servitude, forced into various roles as the ship embarked on a treacherous journey.

For the ensuing three years, Badger was embroiled in their lawless exploits, raiding across the Summer Bay and the Altina Sea. Among these escapades, the raid on Twil stood out, a mission that unwittingly led to a liaison with an engaged human aristocrat named Ariana Eastguard. Twil became the stage for the Phantom Raiders' elegant operation, an opportunity for reconnaissance.

Badger, seizing a chance to infiltrate the Eastguard Villa, accepted a job as a cleaner, ostensibly to survey the most valuable items. But an unexpected connection developed between Badger and Ariana, the Eastguards' daughter. They found common ground, and Badger, longing for someone to confide in, disclosed his true identity.

As the crew prepared for their raid during the night, Badger, ensconced within the villa, remained with Ariana. But when the cannons roared, signaling the commencement of chaos in Twil, Badger knew his time was running out. With the cannons' thunder echoing in the background, he attempted to slip away, intending to reunite with the Phantom Raiders. Ariana, waking up just in time, discovered Badger on the brink of departure.

Ariana, desperately pleading for Badger to stay, recited the intimate moments they had shared, her voice cracking under the weight of emotions. She reminded him of his confessions and the genuine connection they had forged. Badger stood on the precipice of a momentous decision when cannonballs suddenly rained down upon the Eastguard Villa. In a panic, he bolted, believing that if he returned to the ship the Phantom Raiders would end their siege.

As he fled, Ariana, in a final act of affection, bestowed upon him a small pearl from her necklace, a keepsake that now hung as the centrepiece of Badger's own necklace, adorned with sea shells and unrefined stones. He found himself fiddling with it often, a tangible reminder of the past and the choices he had made.

In their final raid, the Phantom Raiders descended upon a secluded monastery, harbouring dreams of plundering the golden icons and holy artifacts held within. The isolated location allowed them no time to scout the target, forcing an uncalculated assault.

The initial assault was chaotic, with a lone priest managing to escape into the sacred woods surrounding the monastery. Badger was tasked with pursuing and showing no mercy, an order he reluctantly followed. For hours, he chased the elven priest through the dense foliage as the desperate cries for salvation echoed.

Finally, Badger cornered the priest, who had pleaded to his god, Savras, for deliverance. Frustrated by the extended chase, Badger subjected the priest to a beating with a belaying pin. Before he could deliver the final blow, an ethereal light enveloped the clearing, heralding the arrival of an overwhelming presence.

In the radiant glow stood a Deva in the service of Savras, a celestial emissary intervening in the midst of darkness. This celestial being revealed Badger's destined path, one that transcended his current life. In that moment, clarity washed over Badger, and he understood that he longed for a life free from plunder and villainy, to find a sense of belonging.

Inspired by the celestial's offer of redemption, Badger chose to follow a new path, one illuminated by Savras, the God of Fate. It was an opportunity to atone for his past sins, guided by the tenets of peace, innocence, patience, and wisdom. A sacred vow was sworn to this newfound purpose, and he embarked on a mission to fulfil his destiny a s an agent of fate.

For the following two years, Badger resided within the sanctuary of the monastery, dedicating himself to learning the teachings of Savras and acquiring the skills of a paladin. His penance for the raid on the monastery was fervent and unwavering. Through devoted study, he uncovered the essence of Savras, a deity intricately tied to the tapestry of destiny. It was revealed that Savras required followers to help guide predetermined events, ensuring that the threads of fate remained unbroken, for without their intervention, chaos would unravel the fabric of reality.

Armed with knowledge and a sense of purpose, Badger was granted passage back to the mainland. There, he swore an oath of redemption to Savras, vowing to uphold the tenets of peace, innocence, patience, and wisdom, while seeking to rectify the wrongs of his past actions and follow the guiding hand of Savras.

Setting forth on the path of a wanderer, Badger ventured to a place where his past misdeeds were unknown, as the nickname "Badger" had been associated with a small, ferocious pirate along the east and south coasts. He eventually found himself in the town of Nestlebrook, where an encounter with a pickpocket targeting a human at the bar would mark a new chapter in his life.
