## üìñ Backstory
From warriors to civilians, he is known as Igris the Eternal.

His past is one of inactivity and an unforgiving curse. He began life as The Paladin of Lliira (Lyra) the Goddess of Joy, over 4000 years ago. As such, he was granted a power that keeps him in prime physical condition. This was one of the many powers of his God, however most would be sealed away following the Fall. It was at this point that his God would cast away his power when binding the Abyss and choose to pass on to the next plane of life, removing the ability to grant eternal life from the world of Batavia. Igris would view this as a path he forced his God to take by failing to be as magically adept as the other Paladins. This self-hatred would cause the absence of Godly power to collapse into a curse, one that would plague him eternally.

Over the years, Igris would come across a small kingdom, the Kingdom of Aefir. It would be in this kingdom that Igris would begin to settle down, starting a family and working as a farmer for a few years. Despite this slow life, Igris would still train his body and mind in the way of the sword, this training would be discovered by the local knights, who would report back to their ruler. Igris would be approached and offered a high-ranking spot amongst the kingdom‚Äôs militia, alongside numerous benefits for his family. He would graciously accept and pledge his blade to serve the kingdom.

It would be late one night; a neighbouring kingdom would invade. The Aefir guard would be outnumbered 20:1, despite this the Aefir guard would have an advantage thanks to Igris‚Äôs skill. This advantage would not last as an explosion would rock the northern side of the kingdom, the area where Igris‚Äôs family were living. Dreading the outcome, Igris would abandon his post and sprint across the kingdom, hoping to arrive in time to save his family.

He was not fast enough.

The despair that followed would cause Igris to ignore everything and kneel in the burning remains of his house, clutching on to the corpses of his family. He would begin calling out to his God, praying for a way to bring back his family. He cries would be met with but a single whisper. A whisper that would come from inside him, in a familiar voice. It was not his God. It was his voice. The whisper said only one thing, ‚ÄúYou are cursed to watch Kingdoms burn‚Äù.

By the time Igris composed himself, the fighting would be over, the Kingdom of Aefir was no more. Igris would spend centuries stalking the ruins of the kingdom as nature moved to reclaim the land.

After all this time, Igris would be approached by a paladin, though it was not one of his former friends. This paladin would inform Igris of the rising threat of Mendartis, an elven emperor who had been banished to the Abyss. Upon hearing about Mendartis‚Äôs connection to the Abyss, Igris realised that Mendartis was not the true threat, instead it was the Abyss beginning to free itself from the bindings of the Gods. Igris would begin a journey that his God would have wanted him to take had he been around to voice a command. Igris, still cursed, would begin to follow the activity and growth of bandit groups and discover that a company called Jackson & Rickles co. was supplying them with everything needed to sow chaos across Batavia, providing the perfect cover for the movement of the Abyss. Igris‚Äôs most recent visits would result in him earning the description of Omen of the End.

This would begin following his appearance near Nestlbrook just days before a bandit attack. It was here that Igris would first witness a group of adventurers, however they were of little concern to him. Before vanishing from the forest line around Nestlbrook, Igris would be spotted by some villagers, all of whom would dismiss him as nothing more than a trick of the mind. This view would change after the attack, and word would spread of this bronze soldier.

Similarly to the Nestlbrook incident, Igris would be spotted again, this time by people shopping nearby as he stood on the roof of the Atlas Inn. Hours later, the Emperor‚Äôs residence would explode. Igris did not know of the disaster. He was instead waiting for the ceremonies to end so that he could scout out the rumours he had heard about the Paladin that guarded the Emperor. The Paladin sounded near identical to one Igris had seen before, the one that often-accompanied Mordinn. This appearance would only further the Bad Omen view that followed him.

Igris would not be spotted for two years. This sighting would be just as Plato‚Äôs army would start preparing for the siege of Windmere. Unlike the previous sightings, Igris would not be staring at one location, his gaze would be constantly shifting between the attacking army and the defenders of Windmere. Igris himself would be unsure as to the outcome of this siege, as he knows of Plato‚Äôs tactical mind but is also aware that the elves are likely controlling Windmere and their tricks and scheming.

The elven tribes situated at the campsites around Omiliri would be the next to witness Igris. All of the tribes would explain how he would be staring at the sky above Omiliri, almost in anticipation of the events that would ensue. Igris would be aware of the plans to corrupt the fae wild, however he would not suspect a ritual used by one of the tribes until after it began. By this point he would be too busy fighting his way through the mushroom men of the infection to be able to intervene. Despite being unable to intervene, Igris would notice the adventuring group he had seen in Nestlbrook (with a few new faces) leave the mineshaft where the ritual occurred. He would follow them from the shadows, watching as they encountered a humanoid that looked identical to one of their members. Soon after they would utilise Mr E‚Äôs connections to his other inns to travel to one in the nearby mountain range. Igris would begin a long trek through the swamp, never resting until he arrived at the inn. He would follow their footprints, left behind in the snow and track them to a valley, just in time to watch two of them collapse, one to an arrow and the other to something unknown.

For an unknown reason, Igris decided to watch. There was something about this group, something that compelled Igris to stay nearby and watch.

Igris‚Äô holy symbol was glowing slightly. Lliira was smiling upon this group.

Whilst the fight progressed, Igris would notice the 4-spoke shield on the unconscious half-elf. This shield was similar to that of the Windmere guard; however, it had a hammer symbol on it. As Igris wracked his brain to figure out why it was familiar, the fight would end, and the injured group would begin to move on. Igris would spend a few hours attempting to recall the location where he had seen the shield. That‚Äôs when he remembered. He had spotted the shield on a human‚Äôs back as they ran towards the Emperor‚Äôs Palace after it had exploded.

Igris‚Äô thoughts became clear, that shield had stood out to him due to the godly power that radiated from it, a god that Igris might have encountered once during his lifetime. This man had spent the night at the Emperor‚Äôs Palace, doing what he could to assist the soldiers present, and had then returned to a building called the Atlas Inn afterwards. Suddenly, Igris realised that this group he had been watching, he had seen before; first at a town called Nestlbrook, then briefly at Windmere, and then finally near the mines at Omilliri and this valley.

Maybe Savras had written a purpose in the weave of time and fate, one that required Igris to encounter this group. This thought process would continue and would result in Igris remembering small details that he had disregarded as insignificant, details such as the shield carried by the gnome with the symbol of Savras, the scaly wings of the female that collapsed earlier, and the Abyssal warlock magic harnessed by the dark elf. These details, whilst seemingly insignificant compared to the signs of the growing strength of the Abyss, were still important. Details that made this group standout from others. Details that, Igris hoped, were signs that this group wielded power and potential that far surpassed that of many other adventurers that Igris had seen recently.

Igris headed towards the nearest Mystery Inn. He would use the Door of Mr E to travel to Windmere and await this group at the Atlas Inn.
