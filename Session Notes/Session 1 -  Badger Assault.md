- **Notable Moves/Abilities Used:**  
	- **The Unleashing of Power**
    
	    - Ga-Al "Spiritlifter" steps forward, magic crackling at his fingertips. With a thunderous _Shatter_, the spell tears through the air, striking both the monstrous troll and the frail old man beside it.
        
	    - Dimble, the old man, staggers—his body unable to withstand the force. His final breath is lost beneath the echoing blast.
        
	    - The troll turns, fury burning in its gaze, revealing **three eerie eye-shaped brands** seared into its forehead.
        
	- **Clash of Blades and Claws**
    
    - Vidal Sunshield charges, sword flashing as he drives steel into the nearest wolf.
        
    - Morte De Duende, stepping into the chaos, feels a **new power stir within him**—an alien presence at the edge of his mind.
        
    - Without thought, he reaches for magic, expecting his familiar eldritch glow. Instead, a dark, swirling mist coils around his hands, **forming spectral daggers**. He freezes, momentarily awed by the unnatural shift.
        
    - Badger issues a challenge, magic laced in his voice. The wolf savaging the gnome snarls but obeys, turning its attention toward him.
        
	- **The Troll’s Wrath**
    
    - With terrifying speed, the troll drops to all fours and **barrels through debris**, heading straight for Ga-Al.
        
    - One wolf lunges at Vidal, its teeth snapping inches from his leg as he absentmindedly ruffles its head.
        
    - Another tears at the gnome, determined to finish the kill.
        
	- **Counterattack and Defiance**
    
    - Ga-Al calls forth a healing word, dragging the gnome back from the brink of death, then **drives his blade into the troll’s thick hide**.
        
    - Morte, still shaken by the **dark energy coursing through him**, flings both spectral daggers at distant wolves. One strikes true, sinking deep into a snarling throat.
        
	- **The Toll of Battle**
    
    - The troll lashes out, **four savage swings**, two finding their mark. Ga-Al staggers under the force, but his body hardens with a warrior’s endurance, reducing the worst of the damage.
        
    - Two wolves turn on Morte, one landing a brutal bite. Blood stains the ground.
        
    - **Somewhere in the distance, a woman’s screams falter… then fall silent.**
        
	- **A Grim Sight & A Haunting Sound**
    
    - As Morte deflects another attack, **his gaze locks onto the treeline.**
        
    - A woman’s body is being **dragged into the forest**, her limbs limp, her fate sealed.
        
    - **A child’s scream cuts through the night—followed by a deafening bang.**
        
    - Ga-Al whirls, eyes narrowing—far ahead, he sees a **wolf smashing through a door**, where the screaming still lingers.
        
	- **Dark Power Awakens**
    
    - Gritting his teeth, Morte **Fey-steps through the battlefield**, positioning himself behind two wolves.
        
    - Lifting his hands, the dark energy surges again, an _Eldritch Blast_ **twisting with unnatural shadows**.
        
    - The spell **obliterates one of the wolves** instantly.
        
	- **A Rogue’s Last Stand**
    
    - Perched atop the troll’s back, Darryn **plunges both blades deep into its skull**—a devastating blow.
        
    - The troll **roars in agony**, its movements sluggish but filled with rage.
        
    - With a wild swing, **its claws rip through Darryn**, knocking him from its shoulders.
        
    - **Darryn crumples to the ground—lifeless.**
        
	- **Retribution and Resurrection**
    
    - Morte, eyes dark with fury, **drives his spectral blade into another wolf, felling it in one swift motion**.
        
    - But then—a gasp. A spark of defiance.
        
    - Darryn’s fingers twitch, his breath ragged. His eyes snap open. **A fighter’s spirit refuses to fade.**
        
    - Badger, seething with rage, raises his weapon and **delivers a final, vengeful strike to the troll**.
- **Outcome:**
