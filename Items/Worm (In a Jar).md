## 🔮 Description

>- Definitely from the Phylum Annelida - “segmented worms,” dude definitely has segments
>- also has the characteristic suckers at both ends (or at least i assume, not like i can see the worm’s ass) which they use to move around
>- bro is therefore a triploblastic, bilaterally symmetrical coelomate with a closed circulatory system - bunch of magical biology words to confuse the Layman
>- Probably from the class Hirudinea - the leeches. Hence our friend can live in marine environments, freshwater, or the got dang dirt i think
>- Lacks parapodia - means got no leggies (or fake leggies)
>- Hirudineans typically have reduced segmentation (you could almost mistake leeches for smooth…) but fella here want to be an outlier wow what a trend setter
>- Blood-based Ectoparasites - latch onto the outside of usually vertebrates (but could be crustaceans, molluscs, insects) and make like a vampire - they can consume up to five times their own body weight in blood depending on the species
>- secrete the anticoagulant Hirudinin when they feed so you won’t clot or bruise - keeps the tasty blood flowing
>- got little “eyes!” - photoreceptor clusters, so they can detect light. they can also detect temperatures and sense host’s body secretions so they can hunt you down dun dun dunnnn
>- ALL hirudineans are hermaphrodites, have both male and female reproductive organs - our non-binary icon
>- can’t reproduce asexually or regenerate parts of their body tho - (also that whole cut a (oligochaete/earthworm) worm in half and youll get two worms thing it absolutely fucking false. all you get is a dead worm. however they can grow back their tails (tails!!! not fucking bodies) and also their heads depending how much you cut off. not this worm tho as i stated before lol that fuckers dead if you start lobbing bits off)
